# "ROBLOX Idle Simulator"

### This project was intended to be a joke but after further consideration I've decided to continue developing this and turn it into a real project

#### What is the goal?

##### There really isn't any to be honest, the game's intention is to be a timekiller and something fun to do in the background while you're doing work or just dying of boredom.

##### But hey, if you want to make the game feel like it's something challenging you could always attempt to speedrun uptil like third rebirth or whatever

#### Features

- **Upgrades**
  > Cash per Second<br>
  > Multiplier<br>
  > Clicking Upgrades
- **Rebirths**
  > Rebirth Points<br>
  > Rebirth Upgrades
- **Clicking** (available after first Rebirth)
- **Critical Hits** (1/100 chance, gives a **10x** boost)
- And many more are on it's way!

#### All the statistics are currently saved via localStorage, planning to add a backend in the future once the game is near completion.

###### (that new shitty roblox game trend definitely heavily inspired this)

[Test the game! (not recommended to play on mobile at the moment)](https://bestidlegame2029.infs.world)

##### i do recommend resetting your data once you feel like something is wrong, the major issues only occur once i make any major changes to the game
